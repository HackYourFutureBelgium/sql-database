# Exercises Week 3

## Final Project<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with SQL for a spin and develop your very own database. We ask that you build something of interest to you, that you solve a substantive problem, that you positively impact others, or that you change the world. Strive to create something you’re proud of.

Although you must work on your project alone, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect "academic honesty".

### Ideas

You can build around any problem you want. To get your thinking started, here are some ideas:

- A database to find your favorite songs, representing artists, playlists, albums, and more (Spotify or Apple Music)
- A database to manage personal finances, storing bank account balances, transactions, budgets, and more (Mint, Quicken, or your favorite banking app)
- A database to help others find friends when they move to a new city, representing people, cities, events, connections, and more (Meetup)

### Template Files

For this exercise you should deliver 3 files:

- [`DESIGN.md`](./your-project/DESIGN.md)
    - See the linked example file for the full description
- [`schema.sql`](./your-project/schema.sql)
    -  Your schema.sql file should include a set of SQL statements to define your database’s schema, annotated with brief SQL comments.
    -  Your schema.sql file will likely contain CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, and CREATE VIEW statements.
- [`queries.sql`](./your-proejct/queries.sql)
    - Your queries.sql file should include a set of SQL queries typically run on your database, annotated with brief SQL comments. Your queries.sql file will likely contain SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE stateme
