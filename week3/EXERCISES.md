# Exercises Week 3

## Final Project<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with SQL for a spin and develop your very own database. We ask that you build something of interest to you, that you solve a substantive problem, that you positively impact others, or that you change the world. Strive to create something you’re proud of.

Although you must work on your project alone, you are welcome to solicit advice from others, so long as you respect "academic honesty".

### Ideas

You can build around any problem you want. To get your thinking started, here are some ideas:

- A database to find your favorite songs, representing artists, playlists, albums, and more (Spotify or Apple Music)
- A database to manage personal finances, storing bank account balances, transactions, budgets, and more (Mint, Quicken, or your favorite banking app)
- A database to help others find friends when they move to a new city, representing people, cities, events, connections, and more (Meetup)

### Template Files

To provide you some structure with which to start building your final project, we’ve provided you with three template files: 
- [`DESIGN.md`](./your-project/DESIGN.md)
- [`schema.sql`](./your-project/schema.sql)
- [`queries.sql`](./your-proejct/queries.sql)

### Submitting your work

Once you've completed your project, please share them with your Coach:
